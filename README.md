# projects

Hi there!

In this repository you can find some of the projects I have done or am currently working on:
- my master thesis (MatLab)
- a project exploring the relations between google & apple data on mobility changes due to the coronavirus and per country
  political measures (Python)

Will be coming as soon as they are readable:
- a hand-made digit-recognizer neural network (MatLab)
- a diffusive climatic model for Earth temperature repartition (MatLab) (obviously temperatures around the globe do not follow a
  diffusive equation, the purpose is only to have fun ; some horrible & ultra strong hypothesis are made) (MatLab)
- some visual illustrations of PCA aiming at providing some insights to non-maths (Python)
