# projects

Hi there!

In this repository you can find some of the projects I have done or am currently working on:
- my master thesis (MatLab)
- a ongoing project exploring the relations between google & apple data on mobility changes due to the coronavirus and per country
  political measures (Python). All data are online, feel free to play with the code.

Will be coming as soon as they are readable:
- some visual illustrations of PCA aiming at providing some insights to some of my non-creak friends (Python)
